# "Cat Energy"
### My recent work
This is my another project from second professional HTML, CSS course. I made this website from a template using Photoshop, Zeplin and Perfect pixel. I made this website as the second project on the course, because I wanted to practice with SCSS after Less and to try to make a responsive website.
#### The HTML markup is semantic using BEM methodology.
On this course I learned how to use preprocessors as Less and SCSS (Sass). Also I got plenty information about optimization, automatization using npm with Gulp, retina optimization and responsive images. I made this site using Mobile-first.
This is responsive website, which has good accessibility.
